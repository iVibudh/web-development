# Notes

## 1. Colours
- Red: Love, energy, intensity
- Yellow: Joy, intellect, attention 
    - Good for headline 
    - Meant to be looked at for a long period of time. People might find it offensive. Could be too attention grabbing
- Green: Freshness, growth, safety
    - good for food
- Blue: Stability, trust, serenity
    - Finance companies (eg: Paypal, Coinbase)
- Purple: Royalty, Wealth, Feminity

- Analogous Colours: (similar colours) Good for navigation bars, body of your page, Logo + background, etc
- Complementary Colours (opposite ends of the pattel): Logo will pop, Flashy 
    - might hurt the eye
    - dont write text or heading with this combination. Might hurt the user's eye. 

- Square, Triangle to have different collour pallets

Two major font families:
- **Serif**: Feet on f. Historical Buildings. Carved into marbles or stone.

Sub families:

    - Trnsitional
    - Modern 
    - Slab-Serif

more friendly, more approachable,

Sensible, Simple, straight-forward
<br>

<br>
Sub families:
    - Humanist
    - Grotesque
    - Gill Sans, Tahoma, Verdana, these are highly readable and highly legible fonts which you can use in the body types
<br> <br> <br> <br> 
- Never have more than 2 fonts 
- 2 fonts of the similar (mood) will help 
    - **Similar**: 
        - Andes & bougan (Mood)
        - Garamond & Ocean Sans Std (Time Era)

## 3. Attention with User Interface (UI)
Monst important information in 
- Herirarchy 
    - Size 
        - bigger font = more impoortant 
        - small font = less important
    - Colours that pop 
        - add to cart, gallery
- Layout
    - Text, pictures, blocks, more interesting
    - 40-60 characters per line is most comfortable for the user. 
- Alignment
    - How you position each of the element with respect to each other
    - Reduce the number of alignment points in a webpage or a presentation
- White Space
    - Inject white space 
    - Looks more premium 
    - Too much cramped together - no good, discount store
- Audience
    - Think about a kids website or a professional website

## 4. User Experience (UX) Design 
- Architect leaves no pathways in university. Students who walk in the path most often automatically make the paths - grass is dead (Desire Lines) 
    - Instead of everything having an aesthetic (forcing everyone to follow the paths laid down) give let users do their thing. 

- Simplicity 
- Consistency 
    - keep the header bar consistent when the user goes from one part of the website to the other is like learning a new skill
- Specific Layout 
    - Use F-Layout
        - Have the most important part of the website on the left gutter
        - Have the logo on the top
    - Use Z-pattern
        - like facebook
- Mobile responsive 
    - Transition from web to mobile & mobile to web should be smooth
    - Too many banners are not good for mobile
- Dont Use Dark Patterns
    - Help people what they want to do by giving them easy access to the tools and services.
    - Dark patterns: patterns which get a user to perform an action or behavior that is beneficial to the company or the designer but it's not necessarily what the user wants. (**Bad User Experience**)
        - eg. Amazon wants you to do express delivery (Makes in Orange - stand out)
        - eg. adding a 1 pixel curved live on the image ad, So when you see it you try to remove the hair and you accidentally click it. Make more money $$$. 
    - Like cheap airlines who charge for everything 
        - I do not want to pay for travel insurance hidden somewhere in a long list of dropdowns
    - Confusing wording in check boxes
        - "If you no longer want us to continue sending you emails please check No".
